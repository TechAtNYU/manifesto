The Tech@NYU Manifesto
======================

######Changelog: 
2012-05-14 - Vivek Patel - <vivek@techatnyu.org> - first commit


###Preface
This document is a compilation of the collective thoughts and notes of the future leaders in innovation. It serves as a living, breathing document that greets newcomers, reminds alumni, orients associates, aligns officers, and guides future presidents. Therefore, anyone may suggest changes--maybe we missed a section. This evolves with the organization.

---

###Mission
Technology moves mountains. It has transformed nearly every sphere of human activity it has touched, and we recognize it as a potent tool to achieve human ends. By creating a culture around this tool, we can create a long-term and sustainable catalyst for innovation.

Tech@NYU aims to foster a technology culture from which companies will be born.


###Method
To get there, we need students continually building anything. Why? It takes a lot of junk, a bag of bad ideas and shoddy execution scars to learn and internalize the nuances of great product and business.  Tech@NYU is the sandbox that students need: a place to experiment, a forum for recognition, a classroom for discussion and learning.

Events are held throughout the academic year, open to all students, with a focus on consistency as to build community (see "Initiatives"). On top of regular events, we hold special events by bringing in top entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and engineers to teach and share their knowledge.


###History
Tech@NYU was created in Fall 2009 to federate the next leaders in technology. Incubated with the help of the NYU Stern Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Tech@NYU held its first event in October 2009 to bring together students across the university to participate in the Berkley Center Business Plan Competition.

We've garnered incredible momentum since then. The organization has done much to bring down the walls between student bodies and foster the kind of culture required for innovation.

We are an officially recognized NYU All-Square club.

###Our context
We call ourselves Tech@NYU. NYU is our home, however:

1. We all inhabit a larger context. Our larger context is New York. What's good for us is good for the city and vice versa.
2. Everyone stands to gain much from connecting and collaborating with peers from other schools.


###Our values
These are values observed in our most successful people, our recruits, and communicated through our initiatives:

1. We esteem individual accomplishment
2. We refuse to accept any constraints
3. We are prolific connectors
4. We wield technology
5. We ship


###Structure
Tech@NYU is a flat network. We have a President that sets a pace and direction, but otherwise there are no organizational titles. We identify ourselves by our initiatives, which may change from year to year. When you strive to recruit the best, most talented, motivated students, shoving them into a hierarchy limits their ability to quickly and efficiently progress. As we esteem individual accomplishment, everyone wears their initiative publicly and with pride.

When joining the executive board, you start as an associate. This does not mean you have any less power than an officer. In the same way we interview recruits to make sure they fit well with us, we like to give recruits an opportunity to see how they like it with us. Once associates found (or pick-up) an initiative, they are considered officers at the discretion of the President. If an associate has not been deemed as an officer within six academic months, their commitment should be questioned. 

---

###Recruiting
Having the best, most motivated students leading this organization is the _most important_ responsibility of each officer. Everything revolves around this. Our structure accomodates the motivated and driven, and crumbles if the right people are not brought onboard. Looking out for students that fit with our culture should always be on the back of our members' minds.


#####To associates:
Welcome! //TODO

The first thing to do is add your name and information to the Executive Board Member information document on Google Docs (http://bit.ly/techatnyudocs). This allows you to reach out to those who may be able to help you on your initative. It also serves as a way to see who has been in the organization.


#####To officers:
Officers drive this culture. There is no Tech@NYU without you. You genuinely care about revolutionizing the world through technology. You relentlessly ship. Professional and hilarious, you know how to get shit done and have fun with it.

Officers should succeed themselves. Look out for associates and peers that are better than you or show more potential. If we keep recruiting at the same level, we will stagnate.


#####To the new president:
Congratulations! This is a humongous deal: you are solely responsible for the progress of the club. The President sets the pace for the club. You relentlessly inspire (or de-motivate) the officers and associates. You embody our values. You constantly think forward about how to progress the organization and the culture it espouses. You are quick and professional in communications with everyone.

It is strongly encouraged this be a 1.5 year commitment. In the last semester, the President transitions into a Chair position, to help the new President transition.

Tips from past presidents:

**'09-'10**: Trevor - //TODO

**'10-'11**: Ben - //TODO

**'11-'12**: Vivek - Communicate a vision, and communicate any progress towards that. Nothing motivates like progress. Also, don't force the culture - put the right people in the same room.


#####To advsiors:
You are the beacons for this movement. We do what we can to help you, and vice versa. You provide the resources and context for us to impart change on a massive scale.

There is a separate Google Groups list for communication, and we meet three times a year to discuss strategy and how to clear any roadblocks. We meet in: May, September, and January. The Chair is the interface between advisors, alumni and the organization.

Initiatives
-----------
Tech@NYU is arguably the most prolific student organization on campus. Here are several of our regular initiatives:

###Weekly:
**HackDays**: HackDays are 4-6 hour mini hackfests for students only. We bring in engineers from the technology community every week to teach a new technology. If you’ve never coded anything before, Hackdays is a great place to learn. If you’re a developer, it’s a nice place to be productive or try something new. 

- Fridays, 5-8 PM, Warren Weaver Hall, Room 317
- URL: http://www.meetup.com/nyhackdays/
- *HackDays Philosophy*:
	1. You’re a lot more productive when there’s a time limit
	2. When learning to code, the fastest way to learn is by making something
	3. The best way to be introduced to new programming concepts is by interacting with other hackers


**DesignDays**: hosted by Parsons: The New School for Design. Our friends at Parsons also share our vision for student innovation. At DesignDays, we teach design principles, analyze designs, and address design problems.

- Fridays, 1-3 PM, 6 E. 16th St., 12th Floor
- URL: http://www.meetup.com/nydesigndays/


**Workshops**: Education is very dear to us. // TODO

- Thursdays, 6-8 PM, Warren Weaver Hall, Room 102


###Monthly:
**DemoDays**: DemoDays is a celebration of creation. 

- Third Saturday of every month, 5-7 PM, Pivotal Labs at 841 Broadway
- URL: http://www.meetup.com/DemoDays/



###Semesterly:
**NYU Startup Week (NYUSW)**: NYU Startup Week is a weeklong event dedicated to _exposing_ students to the innovation community in NYC. This is the largest event we host, with over 1,000+ attendees over the week. Many students enter college with predefined career paths chosen. This event serves to introduce our peers to possible alternatives. NYUSW also serves to recognize the incredible companies being built right next door.

Tech@NYU has historically hosted the event, and still does as the main host, however as of Spring 2012, NYUSW has evolved into an interclub event. A committee of club leaders and the Tech@NYU NYUSW lead should be formed several months in advance to brainstorm and coordinate on the week's events. One club "manages" each day.

- Fall: mid-October
- Spring: beginning of April
- How it runs:
	1. Starting weekend: HackNY hackathon. Coordinate with advisor Evan Korth
	2. Monday - Friday: TBD
	3. Saturday: DemoDays
- Advice:
	1. Book rooms first, months ahead of time
	2. Form interclub committee and brainstorm events
	3. By one month left, lock down speakers
	4. By two weeks left, start promotion (see "Communication")


###Ongoing:
**Innovation Lab**: Having a headquarters of sorts is the next step for this vibrant network. It provides a foothold and a launchpad for new initiatives. //TODO

Communication
-------------
Unlike at many other schools, which have walls and defined boundaries, NYU stands apart as unique. We face adverse conditions for communication: a large, diverse, disperse student body with a lively city that distracts. 

Communication channels:

- Myles Tanzer, at NYU Local
- Washington Square News
- NYUEN (reach out to individual member clubs. Not many people forward news from the list)
- Professors and announcements in class (extremely potent)
- Adrianne Jeffreys, at BetaBeat
- Tech@NYU Digest
- Tech@NYU Twitter, member twitter network
- Facebook ads
- For giant events, email Marc Wais, VP of Student Affairs to get on the NYU Minute


All Square status
-----------------
Tech@NYU is an All Square club, therefore we are granted some benefits and subject to certain limitations. Take advantage of and come prepared to Club Fair--thousands of NYU freshman and sophomores attend this event.

**Benefits**: Legitimacy, Access to Club Fair (Fall and Spring semester), and Visibility

**Limitations**: Paperwork, Bureaucracy

Our Student Life advisor is ~~_Scott Hillman_ (scott.a.hillman@nyu.edu)~~ TBD by August 2012. We can choose to apply for a budget of max $1,000, however it may be higher depending on how we ask. We can also choose to NOT apply for a budget. Reasons for this include: added paperwork, less flexibility in use of funds, and more intimate relationships with our sponsors.

A registered officer must register next year's new officers by June 1st of the previous year.


Finances
--------
Approximately 80% of fundraising happens over the summer. In other words, aim to have all financial requirements met before school starts. We have the opportunity to hold competitions for prize money.

*Important notes*: All money must pass through Student Life and the Budget Office; Our donation fund is "Fund 22"; Have the President and Treasurer pre-sign a number of reimbursement forms to ease the reimbursement process; Create a fundraising packet; **From now on, reach out to the technology giants.**

**'10-'11**: Platinum sponsor is OMGPOP

**'11-'12**: Platinum sponsor is Goodwin Procter LLP
