###Preface
This document is a compilation of the collective thoughts and notes of the future leaders in innovation. It serves as a living, breathing document that greets newcomers, reminds alumni, orients associates, aligns officers, and guides future presidents. The problem with student organizations is organizational memory. Documentation serves to address this problem. This evolves with the organization.

###Mission
Technology moves mountains. It has transformed nearly every sphere of human activity it has touched, and we recognize it as a potent tool to achieve human ends. By creating and growing a culture around this tool, we can create a long-term and sustainable catalyst for innovation.

Tech@NYU is growing the technology culture from which companies will be born.


###Method
To get there, we need students continually building anything. Why? It takes a lot of execution, or *shipping*, to learn and internalize the nuances of great product and business.  Tech@NYU is the sandbox that students need: a place to experiment, a forum for recognition, a classroom for discussion and learning.

We also need diversity. Innovation sprouts from the intersection of thought, and the best way to increase the probability of sparks is by bringing people from different schools, backgrounds, and perspectives together.

Events are held throughout the academic year, open to all students, with a focus on consistency as to build community. On top of regular events, we hold special events by bringing in top entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, designers, artists, and engineers to teach and share their knowledge.


###History
Tech@NYU was created in Fall 2009 to federate the next leaders in technology. Incubated with the help of the NYU Stern Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Tech@NYU held its first event in October 2009 to bring together students across the university to participate in the Berkley Center Business Plan Competition.

We've garnered incredible momentum since then. The organization has done much to bring down the walls between student bodies and foster the kind of culture required for innovation.

We are an officially recognized NYU All-Square club.

###Our context
We call ourselves Tech@NYU. NYU is our home, however:

1. We all inhabit a larger context. Our larger context is New York. What's good for us is good for the city and vice versa.
2. Everyone stands to gain much from connecting and collaborating with peers from other schools.


###Our values
These are values observed in our most successful people, our recruits, and communicated through our initiatives:

1. We esteem individual accomplishment
2. We refuse to accept any constraints
3. We are prolific connectors
4. We wield technology
5. We ship


###Structure
Tech@NYU is a flat network. We have a President that sets a pace and direction, but otherwise there are no organizational titles. We identify ourselves by our initiatives, which may change from year to year. When you strive to recruit the best, most talented, motivated students, shoving them into a hierarchy limits their ability to quickly and efficiently progress. As we esteem individual accomplishment, everyone wears their initiative publicly and with pride.

Tech@NYU also does not have formal membership. Anyone who has attended a Tech@NYU event may be considered a member. There are few executive board members and a vast number of members. A member is someone who has contributed to the community and culture.

### Leaders
Having the best, most motivated students leading this organization is the _most important_ responsibility of each officer. Everything revolves around this. Our structure accomodates the motivated and driven, and crumbles if the right people are not brought onboard. Looking out for students that fit with our culture should always be on the back of our members' minds.


#####To associates:
Welcome!

When joining the executive board, you start as an associate. This does not mean you have any less power than an officer. In the same way we interview recruits to make sure they fit well with us, we like to give recruits an opportunity to see how they like it with us. Once associates found (or pick-up) an initiative, they are considered officers at the discretion of the president. If an associate has not been deemed as an officer within six academic months, their commitment should be questioned. 

Feel free to latch on to something you find interesting, or jump from initiative to initiative. Remember to communicate any moves to the president.

#####To officers:
Officers drive this culture. There is no Tech@NYU without you. You genuinely care about revolutionizing the world through technology. You relentlessly ship. Professional and hilarious, you know how to get shit done and have fun with it.

Officers should succeed themselves. Look out for associates and peers that are better than you or show more potential. If we keep recruiting at the same level, we will stagnate.


#####To the new president:
Congratulations! This is a humongous deal: you are solely responsible for the progress of the club. The President sets the pace for the club. You relentlessly inspire (or de-motivate) the officers and associates. You embody our values. You constantly think forward about how to progress the organization and the culture it espouses. You are quick and professional in communications with everyone.

It is strongly encouraged this be a 1.5 year commitment. In the last semester, the President transitions into a Chair position, to help the new President transition.

Tips from past presidents:

**'09-'10**: Trevor - //TODO

**'10-'11**: Ben - //TODO

**'11-'12**: Vivek - Communicate a vision, and communicate any progress towards that. Nothing motivates like progress. Also, don't force the culture - put the right people in the same room.


#####To advsiors:
You are the beacons for this movement. We do what we can to help you, and vice versa. You provide the resources and context for us to impart change on a massive scale.

We meet twice a year to discuss strategy and how to clear any roadblocks. The Chair is the interface between advisors, alumni and the organization.
